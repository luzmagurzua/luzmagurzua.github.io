        <h1>What is REG-Evolution?</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>RS Conosur started a new journey, giving shape to what we call the <strong>REG-Evolution</strong>. We drove all our commitment to be our best version (<em>Leadership: Play to win</em>). This new era aimed our regulatory evolution and why not through internal revolution?!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Four Pillars of Our Change</h2>

            <button class="accordion">Customer Obsession</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>We focused on being closer to our customers, understanding their needs, and exceeding their expectations.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Digital Transformations</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>We implemented digital technologies that optimize our processes and enhance the quality of our deliverables.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Lean and Fast</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>We strive to be more agile, reducing waste and improving efficiency across all our operations.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Opening Roads Together</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Our team is more united than ever, collaborating and connecting to open new paths together.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Our Transformation</h2>
            <p>Our transformation was deep, conscious, and visible to our partners in the company.</p>
            <p>All teams were fully engaged in driving the change, investing their time in one of the groups. We have already seen a clear impact, being closer and even part of our business, we have been able to define new internal partnerships (<em>Integrity: Collaborate and Connect</em>) and are more vocal in industry associations to continue to deliver new farming solutions.</p>
            <p>We have been able to improve several regulatory processes, gain efficiencies and develop new tools that promote the quality of our deliverables as long as they capture the regulatory criteria that have evolved over the last year. We have new team branding and are actively engaging with new internal groups and stakeholders to communicate our value.</p>
            <p>We are definitely winning on people and culture! More to come. Reg Sciences Conosur has in its DNA the passion for flexibility through innovation and experimentation.</p>
